The uji PL is still under construction.

#### Progress
- Lexer with antlr seems to be OK
- Parser with antlr now also seems to be OK
- No tests at all (no unit/e2e/whatever tests right now). TODO
- No evaluation logic at the moment
- No documentation
- and so on

So now there's something like a parser+lexer and cool grammar.
